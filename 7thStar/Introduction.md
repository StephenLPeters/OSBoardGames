I'd like to experiment with the idea of a board game inspired by [The 7th Continent](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/180263/7th-continent), [Stellaris](https://stellaris.paradoxwikis.com/Stellaris_Wiki) and [The Expanse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(novel_series)).

The expanse proves that an intergalactic mystery introduced to a space fairing civilization can be a very compelling setting. 7th Continent has an ingenious gameplay loop which really brings to life the perils of a doomed exploration. Stellaris has hundreds (thousands?) of anomaly and archeology events which are short, well written narratives which are the source of the games wonder and mystique.  A combination of an expanse-like setting with 7th continent and stellaris game mechanics has a lot of room for the creation of something special.
